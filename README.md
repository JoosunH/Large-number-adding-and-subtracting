# LinkedList
Arbitrary large input addition and subtraction 
The project encompasses the development of two integral components within the realm of data structures. The first component is designed to facilitate versatile traversals in both forward and backward directions. Employing a doubly linked reference-based approach, this structure ensures optimal efficiency in list operations by maintaining distinct front and back references. The second component is a sophisticated implementation geared towards the manipulation of large integers. This encompasses operations such as addition, subtraction, and the ability to alter the sign of the numerical value. The intricate interplay between these components is orchestrated to achieve seamless functionality, ensuring the effective handling of extensive numerical data. The overarching aim is to craft a robust and efficient system that adheres to the specified requirements, demonstrating prowess in both data structure design and numerical computation.
